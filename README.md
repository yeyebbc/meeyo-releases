# Meeye Icon Pack Releases

## Methods of Downloading

### GitHub Releases

Use [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yeyebbc/meeyo-releases/releases) to manually download APKs.

### Obtainium (Recommended)

Use [Obtainium](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.imranr.obtainium.fdroid/) to get latest Meeye directly from GitHub.

However a first time set-up is required:

- Install Obtainium in whichever way you prefer.
- Launch Obtainium and Switch to “Add App” page.
- Paste [this repository’s link](https://github.com/yeyebbc/meeyo-releases) into “App Source URL \*”.
- Press “Add” and leave everything as default or tweak if you know what you’re doing.

### Within Telegram Group

If you have joined Meeye’s only official Telegram group, search for #updates or #更新 to get both Meeye and Meeyo releases.

### OneDrive Shared Link

If you prefer this way, [here is the link](https://1drv.ms/f/c/dc6bae0a0009378c/Eow3CQAKrmsggNwn6gQAAAABQhLORX2toS1y1cUXGKodJw?e=Czcdsq). I will keep them available as long as I am still subscribing Microsoft Office 365.
